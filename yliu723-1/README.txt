I. Tools:
To run the code please make sure Anaconda for Python 2.7 and PyBrain are installed.  

The installation instructions can be found at:
http://continuum.io/downloads#all
http://pybrain.org/docs/index.html

The supervised learning algorithms used are from scikit-learn (Decision Trees, AdaBoost, k-Nearest Neighbors, and SVM) and PyBrain (Neural Networks).


II. Datasets:
The datasets used for analysis are from UCI Machine Learning Repository:
Dataset_1. Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic).  
Dataset:  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/breast-cancer-wisconsin.data
Attribute Information: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/breast-cancer-wisconsin.names 		

Dataset_2. Forrest Cover Type.
Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/covtype/
